- 🔭 I’m currently working on different ROS2 projects, getting involved into the development of Moveit2, ros2_control and various other ROS2 packages.
- I applied Reinforcement Learning approaches for two different robots [BCN3D-Moveo](https://github.com/Nils-ChristianIseke/BCN3D-Moveo_Deep-Reinforcement-Learning) and developed motion planning environments for the [Franka Emika Robot](https://github.com/Nils-ChristianIseke/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-motion-planning)
- I developed a MRI-guided biopsy robot, enabling visual servoing based on DL biopys needle segmenations and ROS2 [Piezobot MRI Compatible Biopsy Robot](https://github.com/Nils-ChristianIseke/piezobot-mri-compatible-biopsy-robot)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning security 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source robotics (ROS2) projects.
- 💬 Ask me about medical robotics, ros2, open source software development
