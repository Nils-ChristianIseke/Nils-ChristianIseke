### Nils-Christian Iseke
Robotics enthusiast, designing, building and programming ðŸ¤–. I love building complex systems and getting deeply involved in every aspect of them. With a bachelor's degree in mechanics, and a masters degree in medical informatics i have a broad understanding of soft- and hardware. I can build an program your robot from scratch.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on different ROS2 projects, getting involved into the development of Moveit2, ros2_control and various other ROS2 packages.
- I have been working with ROS for almost 5 years and developed different ROS Based robots and applications:
  - I applied Reinforcement Learning approaches for two different robots [BCN3D-Moveo](https://github.com/Nils-ChristianIseke/BCN3D-Moveo_Deep-Reinforcement-Learning) and developed motion planning environments for the [Franka Emika Robot](https://github.com/Nils-ChristianIseke/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-motion-planning)
  - I developed a MRI-guided biopsy robot, enabling visual servoing based on DL biopys needle segmenations and ROS2 [Piezobot MRI Compatible Biopsy Robot](https://github.com/Nils-ChristianIseke/piezobot-mri-compatible-biopsy-robot)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning security 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source robotics (ROS2) projects.
